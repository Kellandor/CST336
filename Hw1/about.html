            <p>
                Unity was created by Over the Edge I/S in 2004 before the company name changed to Unity Technologies.
                Unity Technologies was founded by CEO David Helgason, CCO Nicholas Francis and CTO Joachim Ante in Copenhagen, Denmark.
                After their first game failed to gain popularity, the three set out to create an engine as a result of their recognition in the value of development tools.
                Their focus is to make development of interactive contents accessible to as many people as possible. 
                Unity was the first game engine developers to fully support iPhone platform back in 2008.
