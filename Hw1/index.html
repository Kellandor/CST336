                <p id="maintext">Unity is a free game engine developed by <span>Unity Technologies</span>. 
                Unity is typically used to make games but it could also be used in simulations with compute shaders. 
                Being a game engine that supports 2D and 3D graphics, Unity is great as a for beginners who are interested in games development. 
                Unity uses mainly two scripting languages: JavaScript and C#, along with the Direct3D graphics APIs.
                With the drag and drop function used to manipulate game objects, it is incredibly easy to learn.

                Unity supports multiple platforms--Windows, Android, macOS and Oculus Rift, to name a few. 
                Being very versatile, Unity offers developers multiple options to aim at in creating their games. 
                For 2D oriented games, Unity allows the importation of spirtes and advanced 2D world renderer.
                For 3D oriented games, Unity provides support for bump mapping, reflection mapping and other various techniques.
